## Welcome to the ARC GitHub Organization Page
### About Us
ARC is a risk consulting company within the energy sector. Our cyber team handles cyber risk assessment, as well as developing tools to help our collegues and clients with the risk assessment process. 

Our GitHub contains private and public repositories, and provides a place for the cyber team to collaborate on software development projects. While our private repositories are just for internal use, we welcome contributions to issues on our public repositories. 
We love to talk all things risk assessment, incident response, ethical hacking, and more! Join in the discussion or take a look at the open issues to get involved.
